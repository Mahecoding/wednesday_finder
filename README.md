# wednesday_finder
This project allows users to find the next Wednesday's date within a 40 to 50-day range from the selected date. It provides a clean, interactive UI with smooth animations and displays the result in a user-friendly format. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is fully responsive and easy to use.
